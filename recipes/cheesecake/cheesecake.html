    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>0,75 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>0,25 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package instant cheesecake-flavored pudding mix</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        <li>0,25 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>12 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>0,25 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>0,33 cup caramel sauce</li>
        <li>0,25 cup cinnamon graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a sieve with paper towels and place over a bowl. Place pumpkin puree on the paper towels and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator and allow to drain for 2 hours, or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until very smooth. Add 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, pudding mix, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix until well blended. Mix in drained pumpkin. Divide mixture among tortillas and roll them up.
            </li>
            <li>Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>Brush each stuffed tortilla with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Place as many enchiladas in the preheated air fryer as will fit in a single layer with at least 1/4 of an inch in between. Air-fry until golden brown and lightly crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a serving tray and let cool. Repeat to air-fry remaining enchiladas.
            </li>
            <li>Just before serving, top evenly with whipped topping, caramel sauce, and graham cracker crumbs.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
